# pi_monte_carlo
Simple python program to estimate the value of pi using a classic monte-carlo simulation.

**Monte-Carlo Methods** /n
A monte-carlo method relies on random sampling to derive a numerical result.

**Monte-Carlo Method for finding \u03C0**/n
In this well-known approach, the value of pi is estimated using a random number function which generates a number between 0 and 1.
